# Welcome to Mike's Chat with Your Text or PDF File

With this application, you can chat with an uploaded text or PDF file that is smaller than 2MB!

I have enhanced the original version by adding the option of uploading a PDF document instead of being restricted to text.  This uses the PDFLoader class in text_utils.py that I wrote for last week's homework.
